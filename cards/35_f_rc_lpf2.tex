		}
		{An RC lowpass filter effectively forms a frequency dependent voltage divider. At low frequencies, the capacitor acts as a very high resistance, so the signal is attenuated very little. At higher frequencies, the capacitor has less resistance, so the signal is attenuated more. The cutoff frequency of the filter is determined by $F_{c}=\frac{1}{2\pi *RC}$.\\		Transfer function: $H(f)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(\omega*RC)^2}}$		}
