		\cardcontent{\fontsize{9}{10}\selectfont A boxplot is a convenient figure to capture the essence of a dataset. The box stretches from the 1st quartile to the third quartile, meaning it takes the middle half of all samples. The whiskers extend to 1.5 that distance from the median. Outliers are given separately.

		{In addition to the box and whiskers it is possible to give the mean and standard error underneath the box. See Krzywinski, Altman, Nature Methods, 2013, 'Visualizing samples with box plots'}
