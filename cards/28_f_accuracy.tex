		}
		{\textbf{Accuracy}: An instrument’s degree of veracity—how close its measurement comes to the actual or reference value of the signal being measured.\\					\textbf{Resolution}: The smallest increment an instrument can detect and display—hundredths, thousandths, millionths.\\					\textbf{Range}: The upper and lower limits an instrument can measure a value or signal such as amps, volts and ohms.\\					\textbf{Precision}: An instrument’s degree of repeatability—how reliably it can reproduce the same measurement over and over.\\		}
