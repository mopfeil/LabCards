		{Base units are length (meter), weight (kilogram), time (second), electric current (ampere), temperature (kelvin), amount of substance (mole) and luminous intensity (candela). The prefixes for factors of a unit include k(ilo) ($10^3$), M(ega) ($10^6$), G(iga) ($10^9$), d(eci) ($10^{-1}$), c(enti) ($10^{-2}$) and m(illi) ($10^{-3}$). Any physical quantity is expressed as a number mulitplied by a unit (with prefix). For example a weight is expressed as 1 kg, meaning One Kilogramm or 1000 grams. 		}
