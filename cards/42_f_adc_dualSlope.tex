		\cardcontent{The dual slope ADC essentially consists of an integrator and several counters and electronic switches. It is commonly used in digital multimeters.
		}
		{In the dual ramp method, the integrator input is first connected to the unknown ADC input voltage, and charged over a fixed time interval($t_{u}$). For the subsequent discharge, the integrator is connected to a known reference voltage of opposite polarity. The required discharge time($t_{d}$) is determined by a counter; the counter directly stands for the input voltage with suitable dimensioning.\\			Advantages:high accuracy, high resolution, cheap \\			Disadvantages: slow(\textasciitilde 20ms), high precision external components required to achieve accuracy					}
