		{The parallel connection of high pass (HP) and low pass (LP) leads to a bandstop if the cutoff frequency of the LP is lower than that of the HP. The center frequency of the bandpass is calculated as the geometric mean of the unloaded cutoff frequencies of HP and LP. The mutual loading leads to different cut-off frequency values for the bandpass, whose geometric mean in turn produces the same center frequency.\\		BS center frequency: $F_o =\sqrt{F_{c1}*F_{c2}} = 1,63kHz$		}
