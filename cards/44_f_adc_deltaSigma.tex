		\cardcontent{The principle of $\Delta\Sigma$-modulation is based on an initial rough measurement of the signal. The resulting measurement error is integrated and compensated step-by-step via feedback.
		}
		{These steps are carried out very frequently, for example with 128 times the sampling rate. This method has the property of shifting the noise to higher frequencies, which can then be removed with the anti-alaising filter.\\						Advantages: High resolution, no precision external components needed\\			Disadvantages: Slow due to oversampling		}
