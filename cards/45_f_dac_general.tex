		{The voltage at the output has a stepped shape. The step-shaped signal must then be reconstructed and smoothed in a low-pass filter, which must have a cut-off frequency corresponding to half the sampling frequency (Nyquist Theorem). The filtering cuts off the higher frequencies and harmonics, as well as the frequencies around the sampling rate.		}
