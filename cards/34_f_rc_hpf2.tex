		}
		{An RC highpass filter effectively forms a frequency dependent voltage divider. At low frequencies, the capacitor acts as a very high resistance, so the signal is attenuated a lot. At higher frequencies, the capacitor has less resistance, so the signal is attenuated less. The cutoff frequency of the filter is determined by $F_{c}=\frac{1}{2\pi *RC}$.\\		Transfer function: $H(f)=\frac{\omega*RC}{\sqrt{1+(\omega*RC)^2}}$		}
