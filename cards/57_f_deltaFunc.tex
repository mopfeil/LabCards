		{Each circuit has its own transmission behavior. The system response can be determined with a Dirac pulse.  It is used to characterize the response of systems to brief transient inputs. Technically the pulse can be approximated to 10ps half width.	The function can be moved with $\delta(t-t_{0})$. If the $\delta$-function is integrated, the result is the step response.\\[5pt]			$\delta(t) =			\left\{			\begin{array}{ll}				0 		& t\neq0 \\				\infty 	& t=0 \\			\end{array}			\right. $			\qquad			$\int_{0}^{\infty} \delta(t)  dt = 1 = \sigma(t)$ \\		}
