		\cardcontent{Along with the noninverting amplifier, the inverting amplifier is one of the simplest opamp configurations. It amplifies the signal by a fixed gain, while inverting it relative to the supply rails.
		}
		{This is accomplished with negative feedback from the output to the inverting input of the opamp via R2. Combined with R1, this forms a voltage divider that attenuates the output; the opamp then acts to ensure this attenuated version of the output signal is equal to the input signal. The gain of this circuit is thus:		\vspace{2mm}		$G=-\frac{R2}{R1}$.\\		$V_{out}=-\frac{R2}{R1}*V_{1}$.}
