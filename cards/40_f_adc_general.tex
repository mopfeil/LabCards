		{In order to completely reconstruct the signal later, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the maximum possible frequency in the input signal (Nyquist theorem). Otherwise, a sub-sampling will occur that contains frequencies that are not present in the input signal. Therefore  an antialiasing lowpass-filter is connected in front of it.		}
