		{Four-wire measurement is mainly used for measuring small resistances when the parasitic resistances are no longer negligibly small compared to the resistance to be measured. \\		Due to the high input resistance of the voltmeter, the line resistance can be neglected.\\		$R_{Lead} \ll R_{V} \rightarrow I_{Lead}\gg I_{V} \rightarrow V_{M} = V_{R}$\\				Measured Resistance:$\frac{V_{M}}{I} = \frac{V_{R}}{I}$ 				}
