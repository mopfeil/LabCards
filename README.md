# LabCards
A set of cards made to go with a lecture in electrical measurements, still under development, and an excel tool to generate the latex files which in turn create the cards. 

The Excel File Card_data_metrology.xlsm can be used to generate individual latex files for each card as well as a main file that will print 4 cards to a pdf page together with corresponding backs. 

The card layout is specified in the tikzcards.tex file, colors and libraries in colors.tex and libs.tex, respectively. 
The cards folder holds the created cards and the images folder the necessary images for each card. Schematics is used to hold the Spice schematics used to create the images for the circuits and might or might not contain all files as it is not needed to make the cards themselves once the images are there. 

To create a card you can either enter the data in the fields on the first excel sheet, and add it to the list, or directly edit the list.
